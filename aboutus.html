            This organization,The Martinian Times was started by the students of class six of La Martiniere for boys in the hope of giving knowledge to the children which they would find enthralling and amazing. In the recent event of the Covid we have all switched to online platforms and have neglected to learn anything beyond the six inches of our screen. Now that schools have gone back to doing personal interactions some children find it a little difficult to keep up and thus we would like to give them our paper ‘THE MARTINIAN TIMES’ as a gift of knowledge, as a headstart into what they will be learning time to time in the future.</h3>
